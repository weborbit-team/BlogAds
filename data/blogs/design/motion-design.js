    <h2>The Power of Motion</h2>
    <p>Motion design can significantly enhance user experience when applied thoughtfully. Well-designed animations guide users, provide feedback, and create engaging interfaces that feel alive and responsive.</p>
    
    <h2>Animation Principles</h2>
    <p>The 12 principles of animation, originally developed for traditional animation, apply to digital interfaces. Understanding timing, easing, and anticipation helps create natural, believable motion.</p>
    
    <h2>CSS Animations</h2>
    <p>CSS provides powerful tools for creating web animations. Learn about transitions, keyframes, and transforms to create smooth, performant animations that enhance rather than distract from the user experience.</p>
    
    <h2>JavaScript Animation Libraries</h2>
    <p>For more complex animations, JavaScript libraries like Framer Motion, GSAP, and Lottie provide advanced capabilities. Understand when to use each tool and how to optimize for performance.</p>
    
    <h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
    <p>Animations must be performant to maintain smooth user experiences. Learn about hardware acceleration, the 60fps target, and how to profile and optimize animation performance.</p>
    
    <h2>Accessibility and Motion</h2>
    <p>Consider users who prefer reduced motion due to vestibular disorders. Implement respectful motion design that can be disabled when needed while still providing essential feedback.</p>
