    <h2>The Importance of Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Accessibility should be a fundamental consideration in every design decision. Creating inclusive digital experiences ensures that people with disabilities can effectively use and navigate your applications.</p>
    
    <h2>WCAG Guidelines</h2>
    <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a comprehensive framework for accessibility. Learn about the four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust design.</p>
    
    <h2>Inclusive Design Principles</h2>
    <p>Inclusive design goes beyond compliance to create experiences that work for the widest range of users. Consider diverse abilities, contexts, and technologies from the beginning of the design process.</p>
    
    <h2>Assistive Technology</h2>
    <p>Understanding how screen readers, voice recognition software, and other assistive technologies work helps designers create more compatible interfaces. Test your designs with actual assistive technology tools.</p>
    
    <h2>Practical Implementation</h2>
    <p>Learn practical techniques for implementing accessibility including proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, and ARIA labels. These techniques improve usability for everyone.</p>
