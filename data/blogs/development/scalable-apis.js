    <h2>API Architecture Fundamentals</h2>
    <p>Designing scalable APIs requires careful consideration of architecture patterns, caching strategies, and performance optimization. This guide covers essential principles for building APIs that can handle millions of requests.</p>
    
    <h2>RESTful Design Principles</h2>
    <p>Following REST principles ensures your API is intuitive and maintainable. We'll explore resource modeling, HTTP methods, and status codes that create consistent interfaces.</p>
    
    <h2>GraphQL Implementation</h2>
    <p>GraphQL offers flexible data fetching capabilities that can reduce over-fetching and improve client performance. Learn when and how to implement GraphQL effectively.</p>
    
    <h2>Microservices Architecture</h2>
    <p>Breaking monolithic APIs into microservices can improve scalability and maintainability. We'll discuss service boundaries, communication patterns, and deployment strategies.</p>
    
    <h2>Monitoring and Performance</h2>
    <p>Effective monitoring is crucial for maintaining API performance. Learn about metrics, logging, and alerting strategies that keep your APIs running smoothly.</p>
