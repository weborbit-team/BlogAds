    <h2>The Testing Pyramid</h2>
    <p>Effective testing requires a balanced approach across different levels. The testing pyramid emphasizes unit tests as the foundation, with integration and end-to-end tests providing comprehensive coverage.</p>
    
    <h2>Unit Testing Excellence</h2>
    <p>Unit tests form the foundation of a robust testing strategy. Learn how to write effective unit tests, use mocking and stubbing techniques, and achieve meaningful test coverage that actually improves code quality.</p>
    
    <h2>Integration Testing</h2>
    <p>Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly. Explore strategies for testing API integrations, database interactions, and third-party service dependencies.</p>
    
    <h2>End-to-End Testing</h2>
    <p>E2E tests validate complete user workflows and system behavior. Learn how to implement reliable E2E tests using modern tools while avoiding common pitfalls like flaky tests.</p>
    
    <h2>Test-Driven Development</h2>
    <p>TDD can significantly improve code quality and design. Understand the red-green-refactor cycle and how to apply TDD principles effectively in modern development workflows.</p>
    
    <h2>Automation and CI/CD</h2>
    <p>Automated testing is essential for continuous delivery. Learn how to integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines and implement effective testing strategies for different environments.</p>
