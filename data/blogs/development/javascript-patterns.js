    <h2>Evolution of JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript continues to evolve with new patterns and best practices emerging regularly. Modern JavaScript development requires understanding of advanced concepts and patterns that improve code quality and maintainability.</p>
    
    <h2>Async/Await Patterns</h2>
    <p>Mastering asynchronous JavaScript is crucial for modern development. Learn advanced async/await patterns, error handling strategies, and how to manage complex asynchronous workflows effectively.</p>
    
    <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
    <p>Functional programming concepts like immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions are becoming increasingly important in JavaScript development. These patterns lead to more predictable and testable code.</p>
    
    <h2>Module Systems</h2>
    <p>Understanding ES6 modules, dynamic imports, and module bundling strategies is essential for building scalable applications. Learn how to structure your code for maximum reusability and maintainability.</p>
    
    <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
    <p>Modern JavaScript applications require careful attention to performance. Explore techniques for optimizing bundle size, lazy loading, and runtime performance.</p>
